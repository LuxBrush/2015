# Advent of Code 2015 - Bash/Shell Script Solutions

This repository contains solutions for the Advent of Code 2015 puzzles, implemented in Bash/Shell scripting. The project is a personal challenge to help me improve my Bash scripting skills by solving the daily coding challenges presented during the Advent of Code event.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: The main directory containing all the scripts for the daily challenges.
  - `main.sh`: The entry point script to execute solutions for each day.
  - `dayXX/`: Directory containing scripts specific to each day's challenges.
    - `dayXX.sh`: Script with functions to solve the puzzles for that day.

## Acknowledgments

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) for providing a fun and challenging series of puzzles each year.
